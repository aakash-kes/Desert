              Uttarakhand is famous for the Jim Corbett National Park,
              previously known as Haley's National Park. Tourists from all
              around India visit this park to catch a glimpse of the Royal
              Bengal Tigers. Apart from tigers, this national park is also home
              to around 600 species of animals and birds. By the medieval
              period, the region was consolidated under the Garhwal Kingdom in
              the west and the Kumaon Kingdom in the east. During this period,
              learning and new forms of painting (the Pahari school of art)
              developed.[34] Modern-day Garhwal was likewise unified under the
              rule of Parmars who, along with many Brahmins and Rajputs, also
              arrived from the plains.[35] In 1791, the expanding Gorkha Empire
              of Nepal overran Almora, the seat of the Kumaon Kingdom. It was
              annexed to the Kingdom of Nepal by Amar Singh Thapa. In 1803, the
              Garhwal Kingdom also fell to the Gurkhas. After the Anglo-Nepalese
              War, this region was ceded to the British as part of the Treaty of
              Sugauli and the erstwhile Kumaon Kingdom along with the eastern
              region of Garhwal Kingdom was merged with the Ceded and Conquered
              Provinces. In 1816, the Garhwal Kingdom was re-established from a
              smaller region in Tehri as a princely state. In the southern part
              of Uttarakhand in Haridwar district (earlier part of Saharanpur
              till 1988), the dominance and kingship (rajya) was exercises by
              Gujar chiefs, the area was under control of Parmar (Panwar or
              Khubars) Gujars in eastern Saharanpur including Haridwar in
              kingship of Raja Sabha Chandra of Jabarhera (Jhabrera). Gujars of
              the Khubar (Panwar) gotra held more than 500 villages there in
              upper Doab, and that situation was confirmed in 1759 in a grant by
              a Rohilla governor of 505 villages and 31 hamlets to one Manohar
              Singh Gujar (written in some records as Raja Nahar Singh son of
              Sabha Chandra).
